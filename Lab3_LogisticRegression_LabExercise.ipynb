    "In this lab exercise, your task is to classify seismic receiver functions into two categories: good and bad. The bad seismic traces, in practice, are excluded from all further analysis. And only good seismic traces are kept for the subsequent quantitative analysis. To perform classification, you will implement logistic regression using Scikit-learn package. Specifically, you are going to use the [logistic regression](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html) module by importing it from [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/). <br>\n",

    "One common preprocessing step is to normalize your data so that they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. The reasons for doing this are twofold. First, for practical machine learning problems, different features have different scales. For example, when it comes to predicting life satisfaction, the GPD per capita might be on the order of ~1000s, whereas the education system might be ranked on a scale of 0 to 1, with 1 representing the best education. It turns out, features with vastly different scales make the optimization biased toward the ones that have large values (e.g., GPD per capita instead of education system). Secondly, for minimization, the shape of the cost function associated with features of different scales becomes elongated, making the gradient descent type of algorithms less efficient. <br>\n",

    "Next, we need to randomly permute these data before we start doing machine learning. The reason for doing this is to avoid the situation where your training data are ordered in some specific way. For example, it might happen that all the good seismic traces are together, followed by all the bad traces. If we are not careful, our training data set might be all the good seismic traces, and our validation or test data set might be all the bad ones. This is very dangerous because your machine lerning algorithm will not have any chance of learning from the bad seismic traces at the training stage, and you can expect that no matter how you train a machine learning model, it will not predict well on the validation/test data. Randomly permuting the data will ensure that the training set contains data from every category (good and bad), and validation/test set also contains data from all categories. "
